Rubik's cube that scrambles itself and solves itself step by step when user hits space button

SCRAMBLE_RATE is used for the rotation speed during scrambling.
SOLVE_RATE is used for the rotation speed during solving.
SCRAMBLE_MOVES is used for the amount of moves done to scramble the cube and then solve it


This is the test of GPT o1 preview capabilities. I've tested this task on previous versions of GPT such as GPT 4 and GPT 4o.
However, only this model (after 2 tries) was able to corrctly vizualize the rubik's cube
and implement pretty decent 3d model that looks realistic.

For the past 2 tries with this version is that there was a problem with vizualization where the cube was hollow inside.
I think that this issue was caused due to lack of hands-on experience with the rubik's cube for the AI.
It wasn't able to correctly implement the cube's 3d model because by looking at the picture you can't tell
how this cube is supposed to be rotated.

To conclude, the capabilities of this model is astonishing, it is nothing like we had before. 
If it gets his hands on real world, we would develop something trully revolutionary.
